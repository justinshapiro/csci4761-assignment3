How to run: ./mylinkstate <file_name> <node_to_evaluate> <print_intermediate_table>
	- If you do not enter the proper arguments, you will get an error
	- If you enter a <node_to_evaluate> that is greater than the number in the first line of <file_name>, you will get an error
	- If you enter value for <print_intermediate_table> that is not 0 or 1, you will get an error
		- 1 to print the intermediate table, 0 to bypass printing it but still print the forwarding table

* Note: Execution time will probably be shorter if you rerun the program a second time with the same arguments 
*       Execution time (CPU time) is a factor of how long the CPU took to complete the algorithm granted that other tasks not related to this program may have been using the CPU at the same time. Therefore, an average of execution times should be taken into account when assigning the 5 points allocated to this area.
